Add a Blurb about the site here, what does it do, why did you build it?

Add an image of the finished site here. I like to use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) to get an image of my site on all device sizes, and amiresponsive allows you to click links on the page and scroll, so each device can show a different element of your site.

Add a link to the live site here, for Milestone 1 this will be the GitHub Pages Link from when you deployed the site.

If you want to add optional [shields.io](https://shields.io) badges to your README, I like to add them to this section.

## User Experience (UX)

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed user experience section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#user-experience-ux)

## **Agile Methodology**
---
The Agile Methodology was used to develop this website. It was implemented through GitHub and the Project/Kanban Board: 
[Warcraft Mogs](https://github.com/users/nicolemne/projects/3).

### User Stories

#### Iteration 1

#### Iteration 2

#### Iteration 3

### Future Implementations (backlog):

With the Kanban board, the project was split into four sections;

- Todo
- In Progress
- Done
- Backlog (future additions)

## Design

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed design section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/earth-day-hackathon-2022#Design)

### Colour Scheme

Add all information about your colour scheme for your site here. You can explain why you choose the colours you did?

I like to include a palette of the colour scheme here, my favourite site for creating a colour palette is [coolors](https://coolors.co/), but there are lots of other sites that also do the same thing, like [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23F5F5F5&sub=1), [Muzli Colors](https://colors.muz.li/), [Adobe Colour Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) and [Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/) to name a few.

### Typography

All fonts used were already pre-installed with the Bootstrap theme I have chose for this project;
- [Bootstrap Clean Blog](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/clean-blog)

### Imagery

All images are screenshots taken from World of Warcraft content: Copyright ¬©2004 Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. All rights reserved. World of Warcraft, Warcraft and Blizzard Entertainment are trademarks or registered trademarks of Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. in the U.S. and/or other countries.


### Wireframes

Add the images or links for your wireframes here.

There are lots of different options to create your wireframes - Code Institute students can access [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) as part of the course.

Some other options include [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [AdobeXD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html), [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&adgroup=uxui&device=c&matchtype=e&utm_campaign=ADDICTMOBILE_SKETCH_GAD_DG_UK_T1_ALWAYS-ON_S_TRF_PROS_BRAND&utm_term=sketch&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_content=TOF_BRND__generic&hsa_acc=8710913982&hsa_cam=16831089317&hsa_grp=134620695759&hsa_ad=592060065319&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-14921750&hsa_kw=sketch&hsa_mt=e&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gclid=Cj0KCQjwr4eYBhDrARIsANPywCjRIFn93DMezYnsyE5Fic_8l8kynJtut0GYMU01TiohHjwziFtlH0gaAhteEALw_wcB) and [Mockup](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mockup-sketch-ui-ux/id1527554407) to name just a few! Or you can even go old school and get those wireframes completed using pen and paper. Just snap an image of the completed wireframes to add the images to the README.

## Features

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed user experience section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Features)

This section can be used to explain what pages your site is made up of.

### General features on each page

If there is a feature that appears on all pages of your site, include it here. Examples of what to include would the the navigation, a footer and a favicon.

I then like to add a screenshot of each page of the site here, i use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) which allows me to grab an image of the site as it would be displayed on mobile, tablet and desktop, this helps to show the responsiveness of the site.

### Future Implementations

What features would you like to implement in the future on your site? Would you like to add more pages, or create login functionality? Add these plans here.

### Accessibility

Be an amazing developer and get used to thinking about accessibility in all of your projects!

This is the place to make a note of anything you have done with accessibility in mind. Some examples include:

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive.

## Deployment & Local Development

### Deployment

The site was deployed using Heroku, following the steps offered by Code Institute.
You can find the instructions in a Google Docs [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P5CWvS5cYalkQOLeQiijpSViDPogtKM7ZGyqK-yehhQ/edit#heading=h.5s9novsydyp1).

### 1. Creating the Django Project:

- Install Django and gunicorn: `pip3 install django gunicorn`
- Install supporting database libraries dj_database_url and psycopg2 library: `pip install dj_database_url psycopg2`
- Install Cloudinary libraries to manage static files: `pip install dj-3-cloudinary-storage`
- Create file for requirements: `pip freeze --local > requirements.txt`
- Create project: `django-admin startproject project_name`
- Create app: `python manage.py startapp app_name`
- Add app to list of `installed apps` in settings.py file: `'app_name'`
- Migrate changes: `python manage.py migrate`
- Test server works locally: `python manage.py runserver`

### 2. Create your Heroku App:

- Navigate to the Heroku website
- Create a Heroku account by entering your email address and a password (or login if you have one already).
- Activate the account through the authentication email sent to your email account
- Click the new button on the top right corner of the screen and select create a new app from the dropdown menu.
- Enter a unique name for the application.
- Select the appropriate region for the application.
- Click create app
- In the Heroku dashboard click on the Resources tab
- Scroll down to Add-Ons, search for and select 'Heroku Postgres'
- In the Settings tab, scroll down to 'Reveal Config Vars' and copy the text in the box beside DATABASE_URL.

### 3. Set up Environment Variables:

- In you IDE create a new env.py file in the top level directory
- Add env.py to the .gitignore file
- In env.py import the os library
- In env.py add `os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]` = "Paste in the text link copied above from Heroku DATABASE_URL"
- In env.py add `os.environ["SECRET_KEY"]` = "Make up your own random secret key"
- In Heroku Settings tab Config Vars enter the same secret key created in env.py by entering 'SECRET_KEY' in the box for 'KEY' and your randomly created secret key in the 'value' box.

### 4. Setting up settings.py
- In your Django 'settings.py' file type:

```
from pathlib import Path
import os
import dj_database_url

if os.path.isfile("env.py"):
    import env
```

- Remove the default insecure secret key in settings.py and replace with the link to the secret key variable in Heroku by typing: SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get(SECRET_KEY)
- Comment out the DATABASES section in settings.py and replace with:

```
DATABASES = {
  'default': 
  dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
  }
```

- Create a Cloudinary account and from the 'Dashboard' in Cloudinary copy your url into the env.py file by typing: `os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "cloudinary://<insert-your-url>"`
- In Heroku add cloudinary url to 'config vars'
- In Heroku config vars add DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC with value of '1' (note: this must be removed for final deployment)
- Add Cloudinary libraries to the installed apps section of settings.py file:
```
'cloudinary_storage'
'django.contrib.staticfiles''
'cloudinary'
```

- Connect Cloudinary to the Django app in settings.py:

```
STATIC_URL = '/static'
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'STATIC')]
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE =
'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
* Link file to the templates directory in Heroku 
* Place under the BASE_DIR: TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR,
'templates')
```

- Change the templates directory to TEMPLATES_DIR. Place within the TEMPLATES array: `'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR]`
- Add Heroku Hostname to ALLOWED_HOSTS: `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['rhi-book-nook.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']` *Create Procfile at the top level of the file structure and insert the following: web: gunicorn PROJECT_NAME.wsgi
- Make an initial commit and push the code to the GitHub Repository. `git add . git commit -m "Initial deployment" git push`

### 5. Heroku Deployment:
- Click Deploy tab in Heroku
- In the 'Deployment method' section select 'Github' and click the 'connect to Github' button to confirm.
- In the 'search' box enter the Github repository name for the project
- Click search and then click connect to link the heroku app with the Github repository. The box will confirm that heroku is connected to the repository.

### 6. Final Deployment
In the IDE:

- When development is complete change the debug setting to: DEBUG = False in settings.py
- In Heroku settings config vars change the DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC value to 0
- Because DEBUG must be switched to True for development and False for production it is recommended that only manual deployment is used in Heroku.
- To manually deploy click the button 'Deploy Branch'. The default 'main' option in the dropdown menu should be selected in both cases. When the app is deployed a message 'Your app was successfully deployed' will be shown. Click 'view' to see the deployed app in the browser.
