# WARCRAFT MOGS

### **Welcome to Warcraft Mogs README.**

I am a huge fan of the online MMORPG World of Warcraft and have been a loyal player since the early beginnings in 2005. World of Warcraft is not only a game to me, but also a means to express my creativity, by creating cool armour sets - also known as transmogs (mog for short). Transmog is one of my favourite aspects of the game, and I can spend many, many hours just picking out the right shade on a pair of boots. There is a lot of time needed to put in to make these transmogs, as you need to collect all pieces you want to complete your wardrobe. I know there are a lot of like-minded people who enjoy the collecting and creativity that comes with it, as well as wanting to share their creations with other people. 

While deciding what I wanted to do with my fourth project with Code Institute, my boyfriend Dan suggested I do a blog to showcase my own transmogs. I instantly fell in love with the idea and was really excited to begin with this project.

**I hope you enjoy the website as much as enjoyed making it! It's been a roller coaster of emotions, but in the end, I made it through!**

### **Typography**

All fonts used were already pre-installed with the Bootstrap theme I have chosen for this project;
- [Bootstrap Clean Blog](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/clean-blog)

### **Imagery**

All images are screenshots taken from World of Warcraft content: Copyright ©2004 Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. All rights reserved. World of Warcraft, Warcraft and Blizzard Entertainment are trademarks or registered trademarks of Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. in the U.S. and/or other countries.

The header and background image are screenshots taken from in-game World of Warcraft. It is consistent throughout all pages.

### **Wireframes**

The wireframe below is the general idea and vision I had for the website. It follows a basic structure that is the same throughout all pages of the website, with small modifications. 

![Wireframes](media/images/wireframes.png)

## **Features**

👩🏻‍💻 View an example of a completed user experience section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Features)

This section can be used to explain what pages your site is made up of.

### **General features on each page**

All pages feature a navigation bar with access to the following pages: Home, About, Contact, Register and Sign in. If you are already logged in, you can access the pages Upload Post and Sign Out. 
The footer is also present on all of the pages, with links to my social media accounts and GitHub. 

### **Future Implementations**

To expand this website further, I would like to add these future implementations:
- The ability to enlarge the images in the detailed view
- Create a user page, and the ability to view other user pages
- Search field
- Create drafts

More features and ideas may be added in the future.

### **Accessibility**

I have tried my best to be mindful of accessibility, and the steps I've taken for this are the following:

- Descriptive information about every image on the gallery page
- Aria labels to the social media links
- Chose a good colour contrast throughout the website
- Semantic HTML

## **Deployment & Local Development**

### **Deployment**

The site was deployed using Heroku, following the steps offered by Code Institute.
You can find the instructions in a Google Docs [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P5CWvS5cYalkQOLeQiijpSViDPogtKM7ZGyqK-yehhQ/edit#heading=h.5s9novsydyp1).

### **1. Creating the Django Project:**

- Install Django and gunicorn: `pip3 install django gunicorn`
- Install supporting database libraries dj_database_url and psycopg2 library: `pip install dj_database_url psycopg2`
- Install Cloudinary libraries to manage static files: `pip install dj-3-cloudinary-storage`
- Create file for requirements: `pip freeze --local > requirements.txt`
- Create project: `django-admin startproject project_name`
- Create app: `python manage.py startapp app_name`
- Add app to list of `installed apps` in settings.py file: `'app_name'`
- Migrate changes: `python manage.py migrate`
- Test server works locally: `python manage.py runserver`

### **2. Create your Heroku App:**

- Navigate to the Heroku website
- Create a Heroku account by entering your email address and a password (or log in if you have one already).
- Activate the account through the authentication email sent to your email account
- Click the new button on the top right corner of the screen and select Create a new app from the dropdown menu.
- Enter a unique name for the application.
- Select the appropriate region for the application.
- Click Create app
- In the Heroku dashboard click on the Resources tab
- Scroll down to Add-Ons, search for and select 'Heroku Postgres'
- In the Settings tab, scroll down to 'Reveal Config Vars' and copy the text in the box beside DATABASE_URL.

### **3. Set up Environment Variables:**

- In your IDE, create a new env.py file in the top-level directory
- Add env.py to the .gitignore file
- In env.py import the os library
- In env.py add `os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]` = "Paste in the text link copied above from Heroku DATABASE_URL"
- In env.py add `os.environ["SECRET_KEY"]` = "Make up your own random secret key"
- In Heroku Settings tab Config Vars enter the same secret key created in env.py by entering 'SECRET_KEY' in the box for 'KEY' and your randomly created secret key in the 'value' box.

### **4. Setting up settings.py:**
- In your Django 'settings.py' file type:

```
from pathlib import Path
import os
import dj_database_url

if os.path.isfile("env.py"):
    import env
```

- Remove the default insecure secret key in settings.py and replace with the link to the secret key variable in Heroku by typing: SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get(SECRET_KEY)
- Comment out the DATABASES section in settings.py and replace it with:

```
DATABASES = {
  'default': 
  dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
  }
```

- Create a Cloudinary account and from the 'Dashboard' in Cloudinary copy your url into the env.py file by typing: `os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"] = "cloudinary://<insert-your-url>"`
- In Heroku add cloudinary url to 'config vars'
- In Heroku config vars add DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC with value of '1' (note: this must be removed for final deployment)
- Add Cloudinary libraries to the installed apps section of settings.py file:
```
'cloudinary_storage'
'django.contrib.staticfiles''
'cloudinary'
```

- Connect Cloudinary to the Django app in settings.py:

```
STATIC_URL = '/static'
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'
STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'STATIC')]
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE =
'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
* Link file to the templates directory in Heroku 
* Place under the BASE_DIR: TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR,
'templates')
```

- Change the templates directory to TEMPLATES_DIR. Place within the TEMPLATES array: `'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR]`
- Add Heroku Hostname to ALLOWED_HOSTS: `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['rhi-book-nook.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']` *Create Procfile at the top level of the file structure and insert the following: web: gunicorn PROJECT_NAME.wsgi
- Make an initial commit and push the code to the GitHub Repository. `git add . git commit -m "Initial deployment" git push`

### **5. Heroku Deployment:**
- Click the Deploy tab in Heroku
- In the 'Deployment method' section select 'Github' and click the 'Connect to GitHub' button to confirm.
- In the 'search' box enter the Github repository name for the project
- Click search and then click connect to link the Heroku app with the GitHub repository. The box will confirm that Heroku is connected to the repository.

### **6. Final Deployment:**
In the IDE:

- When development is complete change the debug setting to: DEBUG = False in settings.py
- In Heroku settings config vars, change the DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC value to 0
- Because DEBUG must be switched to True for development and False for production it is recommended that only manual deployment is used in Heroku.
- To manually deploy click the button 'Deploy Branch'. The default 'main' option in the dropdown menu should be selected in both cases. When the app is deployed a message 'Your app was successfully deployed' will be shown. Click 'view' to see the deployed app in the browser.
