# PROJECT PORTFOLIO 4 - WARCRAFT MOGS - TESTING

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of this section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Found-In-Translation/blob/main/TESTING.md#found-in-translation----testing-documentation)

Add an image of the finished site here. I like to use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) to get an image of my site on all device sizes, and amiresponsive allows you to click links on the page and scroll, so each device can show a different element of your site.

Add a link to the live site here, for Milestone 1 this will be the GitHub Pages Link from when you deployed the site.

If you want to add optional shields.io badges to your TESTING file, I like to add them to this section (Shields.io have some badges for W3C validation which makes it easy to see at a glance whether the project has passed validation).

## Validators

###  W3C Validator

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed W3C HTML & CSS validation section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms/blob/main/TESTING.md#W3C-Validator)

The most popular HTML validator is [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/). There are two ways to validate the HTML for your first milestone - you can copy the live link for your site page and paste into the validate by URI field, or you can copy all the code for your page and paste this into the validate by direct input field.

#### **URI Input**

If you validate with your sites URL, you can run the validation and then copy the link from the address bar and insert the link here as your proof of validation.

![W3C URI Validator](documentation/milestone1-testing/w3c-uri-validatation.png)

#### **Direct Input**

If you validate with the code, you will need to screenshot the validation results and then link the image here.

![W3C Direct Input Validator](documentation/milestone1-testing/w3c-directinput-validation.png)

#### **CSS Validation**

CSS Validation can only be done by copying and pasting the CSS file contents into the direct input. Make sure that the checkbox for CSS is selected.

### Lighthouse

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed lighthouse testing section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/earth-day-hackathon-2022/blob/main/TESTING.md#Lighthouse)

Lighthouse Testing is part of the Chrome Developer Tools. For more information on how to use this tool, please visit [chrome Lighthouse](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?hl=en#:~:text=Lighthouse%20is%20an%20open%2Dsource,how%20well%20the%20page%20did.).

You will need to run the Lighthouse testing on each individual page of your site, for desktop as a minimum. If you have time it would be great to also add in the mobile testing.

### WAVE

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed WAVE testing section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/earth-day-hackathon-2022/blob/main/TESTING.md#WAVE)

[WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) is an accessibility testing tool. I like to run this on each page of my site and take a screenshot of the results to add here. They have a website for testing and a Chrome extension.

## MANUAL TESTING

### Testing User Stories

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed user stories testing section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/BookWorm/blob/main/TESTING.md#Testing-User-Stories)

This is where you will test the user stories you created in the README against your site. I like to use a table for this section - I create a column for the user stories goals, how these have been achieved and I use the third column to add any supporting images.

### Full Testing

Full testing was performed on the following devices:

* Laptop:
  * Macbook Pro 2021 14 inch screen
* Mobile Devices:
  * iPhone 13 pro.
  * iPhone 11 pro.
  * Phone X.

Each device tested the site using the following browsers:

## BUGS

### Known Bugs

List (or put in a table) all known bugs on your site here as soon as you find them. This will prevent you from forgetting any at the end. Some (if not all) of these bugs will hopefully make their way over to the next section, solved bugs, as you progress through your project.

### Solved Bugs

| No | Bug | How I solved the issue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | When I tried to access the /admin site when the server was ran locally, I would receive error messages such as DISALLOWED HOST, which made me unable to access the Admin site. | By adding the Gitpod URL to the ALLOWED_HOSTS in settings.py as well as adding the SITE_ID = 1, the problem was solved. |
| 2 | Everytime a new post was uploaded with an image, the images would appear in different sizes - making the content appear out of alignment. | After a lot of testing back and forth, moving the % for post in post_list % placement to underneath the first div, made the content align neatly. |
| 3 | The main content in the pages had a slight gap from the header | By adding the Bootstrap class mb-0 to the header class in base.html, I was able to remove the margin. |
| 4 | Nothing happening after uploading a post on the website via the upload_post.html. The post does not get sent to admin for approval. | By adding the def form_valid to my UploadPost view, I was able to upload a blog post logged in as admin, to the admin site, and from there I was able to set the blog post to published to display it on the website. The def form_valid sets the author of the post as the current user and sets the post to a 0 (Draft). By calling the super().form_valid(form), the data is then saved to the database. |
| 5 | After solving the first issue with the blog post not being saved and sent to the admin for publishing, I logged in with a different user to test if I was able to upload a blog post. I received an error "UNIQUE constraint failed: blog_post.slug", which indicated that the slug generated on the blog post already exists in the database. | To fix this issue I had to start with importing the get_random_string from the django.utils.crypto as well as the slugify from the django.utils.text module to make it possible to generate a unique slug from the title (if there was already a title existing with the same name). I then had to iterate with a while loop through the database to check if a slug already exists with that title. If the title is not unique, it appends a random string (with the help of the get_random_string) to the slug to make it unique inside the while loop. Lastly, when a unique slug is made, it is saved and set to the post it has been generated for. |
| 6 | When submitting a comment, the comment textarea is not emptied when reloading the page, which results in the same comment being posted again. | Added "return redirect('post_detail', slug=slug)" to the comment_form if statement, to return back to the post when a comment has been successfully submitted. |
| 7 | When deleting a comment, the comment wasn't actually removed from the database, but only removed from the frontend. The comments count function was still displaying the amount of comments although some were deleted. | Added a "DeleteView" inherit to the DeleteComment class, which updates the database correctly. |
